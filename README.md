# Internet of Things and Workplace Organization

## Background

Having a dynamic and highly re-configurable workplace is one of the critical keys to every organization's success [1]. This design would help us organize our assets within each team, enable collaborations among teams, as well as facilitate interactions with our clients. For example, many work requests may come to our workspace very quickly and many products need to be taped out as quickly as possibly to our customers. This is a very tight situation for many of us and our partners. However, this problem presents an opportunity for a friendly user interface that would a) help us locate and/or retrieve our assets quickly within any given workspace, b) help our partners manage their assets within our organization and, c) provide our clients and/or members with available options right at their fingertips.

## Discussion:

There are a lot of workspaces within each organization [2]. It would become a daunting task to sort and retrieve our assets quickly. However, it would be useful if there is a simple interface that would take us to a dedicated workspace where our assets should be located. Let's start out with the following login screen:

From there, the work items can be organized by our associates and displayed on a smart device, with rows and columns. The information can be presented in either back-end or front-end, as in the following snapshot:

We can then identify where a particular asset is, even if there are multiple locations for it. There should be a HIGHLIGHT mode where our assets can be spotted with ease. This feature would help us replenish and/or retrieve any given work item quickly, or at least with minimal downtime. This task can be accomplished as described with the following snapshots, where all instances of a user-specified asset are highlighted (i.e. orange on even rows, blue on odd rows):

As time goes by and/or during normal operation, many more work items arrive and should be added to our database. It would become a storage management problem if we can NOT load these additional items into existing workspaces (i.e. we would run of space in our organization). However, it would be useful if there is an option to ADD any new work item into a row of an existing workspace, either to the left or the right of an anchor point (i.e. an existing asset). The anchor could be selected as in the following snapshot:

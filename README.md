# Internet of Things and Workplace Organization

## Background

Having a dynamic and highly re-configurable workplace is one of the critical keys to every organization's success [1]. This design would help us organize our assets within each team, enable collaborations among teams, as well as facilitate interactions with our clients. For example, many work requests may come to our workspace very quickly and many products need to be taped out as quickly as possibly to our customers. This is a very tight situation for many of us and our partners. However, this problem presents an opportunity for a friendly user interface that would a) help us locate and/or retrieve our assets quickly within any given workspace, b) help our partners manage their assets within our organization and, c) provide our clients and/or members with available options right at their fingertips.

## Discussion:

There are a lot of workspaces within each organization [2]. It would become a daunting task to sort and retrieve our assets quickly. However, it would be useful if there is a simple interface that would take us to a dedicated workspace where our assets should be located. Let's start out with the following login screen:

From there, the work items can be organized by our associates and displayed on a smart device, with rows and columns. The information can be presented in either back-end or front-end.
